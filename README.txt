Game of Life by John Conway
========================

In the 1970s, the mathematician John Horton Conway imagined a game consisting of a grid of living or dead cells as well as 2 simple rules:

1- If a living cell is surrounded by less than 2 or over 3 living cells, that cell will die. If not, it survives.
2- If a dead cell is surrounded by exactly 3 living cells, that cells forms into a living cell.

Just those two rules created what is known as Game of Life (or simply Life), a playerless simulation which signifies that its evolution
depends and depends only on its initial state.

Q: What's a false-positive?
A: A false-positive is when a certain antivirus considers an executable file as malicious software. This is due to the software not having a verified author/signature (certificate).

False-positives can happen quite often with executable files (.EXE).
If you feel unsafe with this file, feel free to delete it.
If you suspect it to be a virus, it isn't. I wouldn't develop such a thing. I don't find messing up someone's PC as "fun".

Enjoy the game!
