Game of Life by John Conway
========================

In the 1970s, the mathematician John Horton Conway imagined a game consisting of a grid of living or dead cells as well as 2 simple rules:

1- If a living cell is surrounded by less than 2 or over 3 living cells, that cell will die. If not, it survives.
2- If a dead cell is surrounded by exactly 3 living cells, that cells forms into a living cell.

Just those two rules created what is known as Game of Life (or simply Life), a playerless simulation which signifies that its evolution
depends and depends only on its initial state.
